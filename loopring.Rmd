This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
raw_data <- read.csv(file='networkloopringTX.txt',header=F,sep=' ')
colnames(raw_data)<-c("Seller","Buyer","TimeStamp","TokenAmount")
nrow(raw_data)
```

```{r}
summary(raw_data)
```

```{r}
Total.circulation.amount<- 828854240 * (10^18)
Total.circulation.amount
```

```{r}
outliers <- subset(raw_data,TokenAmount>Total.circulation.amount)
message("# of outlier rows:", nrow(outliers))

```

```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
